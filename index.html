                <p>Hello World!  My name is Gerardo Garcia.  I am 42 years old, married and a father of two.  
                    My wife's name is Evangelina and we have been married for 13 years.  
                    I have a 11 year old son named Max and a 5 year old daughter named Nayeli.
                    I currently live in the city of Hercules, CA.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I am currently working as a Sales Engineer for a company called Ixia.
                    I enjoy my job but I am looking to try something new.  I signed up for a coding bootcamp
                    to see if it was something I could get into.  I have done some programming before in TCL
                    and Python but I would consider myself more of a hack when it comes to coding.  I'm hoping to 
                    learn the proper way to code and have some fun along the way.            
                </p>
